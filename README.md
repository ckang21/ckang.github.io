Styles:
  Used a Arial Helvetica Sans Serif font on all text

  For my table I had one pixel solid black border, three pixel padding, three pixel spacing, vertically aligned with the top, text was aligned to the left, it had a fixed layout and had a width of one hundred pixels. It also had a variety of colors for the classes and columns

  The body had a background image of a blue sky, set to fixed.

  The div tag centered everything

  The picture of me had a height of 600 and a width of 500 pixels
